# Simulations

This repository contains code for simulating imbalanced mixed-type datasets and using mixed-type distances for anomaly detection. The project contains a folder with the main functions used in this work, and a vignette available at: [intro.html](https://joaoahrodrigues.github.io/Simulations/intro.html).
