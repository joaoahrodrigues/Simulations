# Simulations

This repository contains code for simulating imbalanced mixed-type datasets and using mixed-type distances in a anomaly detection framework. The project is modular, with all functions stored under a dedicated directory and a single orchestration script for reproducibility, available at: [example.html](https://joaoahrodrigues.github.io/Simulations/example.html)
